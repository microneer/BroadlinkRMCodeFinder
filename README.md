# BroadlinkRMCodeFinder

This tool calls the API provided by the [RM Bridge Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.fun2code.android.rmbridge&hl=en)
so you can use a Broadlink device to read IR codes from your remote control(s) and put them into an OpenHAB2 transformation/map file so OpenHAB2 can replay them through the same or different Broadlink devices.

## Instructions

Download the project into a local directory and open index.html in your favourite browser. Further instructions are provided on that page.

Further information is available on the [OpenHAB2 forum topic about the Broadlink binding](https://community.openhab.org/t/broadlink-binding-for-rmx-a1-spx-and-mp-any-interest/22768).
